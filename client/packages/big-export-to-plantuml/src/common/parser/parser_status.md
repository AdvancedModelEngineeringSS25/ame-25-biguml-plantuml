- Association and Generalization on actor have a very small click box

### Additional Notes

- Nodes must be created inside an activity partition, which itself must be inside an activity container.
- Nodes can be placed directly in the activity container, but they disappear or break after reload.
- Nodes not shown in the container still exist in the outline, but cannot be deleted from there.

## General

- When entering a name for a new element, pressing "N" switches to the primary navigation.
- In PlantUML every object needs a unique name, how to handle same names?
